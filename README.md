This is a small collatz conjecture analyser based on javascript works on browsers.

There are various ways to use this, its not yet finished and any support and work on how to make it better is appreciated. ThankYOU For using it ^_^.

# How to - Guide

### Start : 
   You can enter a specfic number directly into the "Specific" field or go for a range using Range fields "from" and "to" and after doing this, click on calculate. after calculating it will show results as a table.

### Analyse :
   After calculation you would want to analyse the given information, you can use the "Select Analysing Method" drop down to select a form of analysing based on certain pattern. There might be not all the options you need, you can suggest us, this is very appreciated.

### Filterations :
   After all these, if you still want to bend it in some more ways, you can use the filteration table[working on to make it a drop down] to filter the                      results, the methods and what they do is described if you hover on them, you can play around and understand them your self.
   
   => If its hard to see the filtered rows. you can use the "Remove Unfiltered" field with value of 1\0 to remove tables which do not belong to the filter
